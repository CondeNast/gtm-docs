# Tagging 3rd party ecommerce & membership clubs

Just like Condé Nast tags its editorial and other owned-and-operated websites up with Google Tag Manager (GTM)
in order to run GA (Google Analytics), TD (Treasure Data), Permutive and other scripts, Condé Nast also intends
to tag ecommerce websites and membership clubs. The intention is to ensure continuity of data collection and
insight on users as they move outside websites Condé Nast directly owns and operates. This would empower,
for example, being able to segment users (on 3rd party sites) who have added to basket but not completed.

Such other 3rd party websites websites are generally operated by external partners who sell
magazine subscriptions, or offer other ecommerce activities such as merchandise stores or
private membership clubs. Examples include:

- www.magazineboutique.co.uk - Operated by CDS UK for the British market
- editorsclub.gq-magazine.co.uk - Operated by Pugpig for the British market

A full list (~70 websites) is available in this [google sheet](https:.

Other similar examples exist in all markets.
